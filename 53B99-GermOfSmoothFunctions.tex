If $x$ is a point on a smooth manifold $M$, then a {\em germ of smooth functions near $x$} is represented by a pair $(U,f)$ where $U \subseteq M$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$, and $f$ is a smooth function $U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Two such pairs $(U,f)$ and $(V,g)$ are considered equivalent if there is a third open neighbourhood $W$ of $x$, contained in both $U$ and $V$, such that $f|_W=g|_W$. To be precise, a germ of smooth functions near $x$ is an equivalence class of such pairs. 

In more fancy language: the set $\mathcal{O}_x$ of germs at $x$ is the stalk at $x$ of the sheaf $\mathcal{O}$ of smooth functions on $M$. It is clearly an $\mathbb{R}$-algebra.

Germs are useful for defining the tangent space $T_x M$ in a coordinate-free manner: it is simply the space of all $\mathbb{R}$-linear maps $X:\mathcal{O}_x \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying Leibniz' rule $X(fg)=X(f)g+fX(g)$. (Such a map is called an $\mathbb{R}$-linear derivation of $\mathcal{O}_x$ with values in $\mathbb{R}$.)
