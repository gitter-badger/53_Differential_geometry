\begin{document}
Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are smooth curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which pass through 
a common point $P$.  We say that $A$ and $B$ have zeroth order contact if their
tangents at $P$ are distinct.

Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are tangent at $P$.  We may then set up a coordinate
system in which $P$ is the origin and the $x_1$ axis is tangent to both curves.
By the implicit function theorem, there will be a neighborhood of $P$ such that
$A$ can be described parametrically as $x_i = f_i (x_1)$ with $i = 2, \ldots, n$
and $B$ can be described parametrically as $x_i = g_i (x_1)$ with 
$i = 2, \ldots, n$.  We then define the \emph{order of contact} of $A$ and $B$ 
at $P$ to be the largest integer $m$ such that all partial derivatives of $f_i$ 
and $g_i$ of order not greater than $m$ at $P$ are equal.
