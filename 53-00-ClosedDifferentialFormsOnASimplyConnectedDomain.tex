Let $D\subset \mathbb R^2$ be an open set and let $\omega$ be a differential form defined on $D$.

\begin{theorem}
If $D$ is simply connected and $\omega$ is a closed differential form,
then $\omega$ is an exact differential form.
\end{theorem}

The proof of this result is a consequence of the following useful lemmas.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\omega$ be a closed differential form 
and suppose that $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are two regular homotopic curves in $D$ (with the same end points). Then 
\[
  \int_{\gamma_0} \omega = \int_{\gamma_1}\omega.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\omega$ be a continuous differential form.
If given any two curves $\gamma_0$, $\gamma_1$ in $D$ with the same end-points,
it holds
\[
  \int_{\gamma_0} \omega = \int_{\gamma_1} \omega,
\]
then $\omega$ is exact.
\end{lemma}

See the Poincar\'e Lemma for a generalization of this result on $n$-dimensional manifolds.
