\begin{document}
Axial vector behaves like a vector (polar vector) except that it is invariant under the inversion of its coordinate axes. For example, the cross product of two vectors $\bold{A}$ and $\bold{B}$, $$\bold{A}\times\bold{B}$$ is an axial vector. 
The cross product of two axial vectors stays as an axial vector, whereas the cross product of an axial vector and a polar vector turns to be a polar vector.
