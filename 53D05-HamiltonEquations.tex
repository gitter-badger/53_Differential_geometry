The Hamilton equations are a formulation of the equations of motion in classical mechanics.

\subsubsection*{Local formulation}
Suppose $U\subseteq \R^n$ is an open set, suppose $I$ is an interval
(representing time), and $H\colon U\times \R^n\times I\to \R$
is a smooth function. Then the equations
\begin{align}
\label{HE1}
\dot{q}_j &= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_j}(q(t),p(t),t), \\
\label{HE2}
\dot{p}_j &= -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_j}(q(t),p(t),t), 
\end{align}
are the \emph{Hamilton equations} for the curve
$$
  (q, p)=(q_1,\ldots, q_n, p_1,\ldots, p_n) \colon I\to U\times \R^n.
$$
Such a solution is called a \emph{bicharacteristic}, and $H$ is
called a \emph{Hamiltonian function}. Here we use classical notation;
the $q_i$'s represent the location of the particles, 
the $p_i$'s represent the momenta of the  particles.


\subsubsection*{Global formulation}
Suppose $P$ is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form $\omega$ and that $H\colon P\to \R$
is a smooth function.  Then $X_H$, the Hamiltonian 
vector field corresponding to $H$ is determined by 
$$
  dH=\omega(X_H,\cdot).
$$
The most common case is when $P$ is the cotangent bundle of a manifold $Q$
equipped with the canonical symplectic form $\omega=-d\alpha$, 
where $\alpha$ is the \PMlinkname{Poincar\'e $1$-form}{Poincare1Form}.  (Note that other authors may have different sign convention.)  Then Hamilton's equations are the equations for the flow of the vector field $X_H$.  Given a system of coordinates $x^1, \ldots x^{2n}$ on the manifold $P$, they can be written as follows:
$$
 \dot x^i = (X_H)^i (x_1, \ldots x_{2n}, t)
$$
The relation with the former definition is that in canonical 
local coordinates $(q_i,p_j)$ for $T^\ast Q$, the flow of $X_H$ 
is determined by equations \eqref{HE1}-\eqref{HE2}.

Also, the following terminology is frequently encountered --- the manifold $P$ is known as the phase space, the manifold $Q$ is known as the configuration space, and the product $P \times\R$ is known as state space.
