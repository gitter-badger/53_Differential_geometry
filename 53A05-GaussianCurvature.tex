\begin{document}
The \emph{Gaussian curvature} of a surface at a point $p$ is the product 
$$
K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2
$$
of the two principal curvatures of the surface at $p$.

The arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures at a point $p$
$$
H = \frac{\kappa_1 + \kappa_2}{2}
$$
is called the \emph{mean curvature} of the surface at 
$p$.
