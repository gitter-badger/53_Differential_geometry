A Riemannian metric on a manifold $M$ is said to be {\bf geodesically complete} iff its geodesic flow is a complete flow,
i.e. iff for every point $p\in M$ and every tangent vector $v\in T_pM$ at $p$ the solution to the geodesic equation
$$
\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}\dot{\gamma}=0
$$
with initial condition $\gamma(0)=p$, $\dot{\gamma}(0)=v$ is defined for all time. 
The Hopf-Rinow theorem
asserts that a Riemannian metric is complete if and only if the corresponding metric on $M$ defined by
$$
   d(p,q)\colon=\inf\{L(c), \; c\colon[0,1]\to M,\; c(0)=p,\; c(1)=q\}
$$
is a complete metric (i.e. Cauchy sequences converge). Here $L(c)$ denote the length of the smooth curve $c$, i.e.
$$
   L(c)\colon=\int_0^1 \|\dot{c}(t)\|_{c(t)} \,dt
$$
For a proof of the Hopf-Rinow theorem see Milnor's monograph {\em Morse Theory} 
Princeton Annals of Math Studies {\bf 51} page 62.
