\begin{document}
Let $\Gamma$ be a family of plane curves.\, The {\em isocline} of $\Gamma$ is the locus of the points, in which all members of $\Gamma$ have an equal slope.

If the family $\Gamma$ has the differential equation
$$F(x,\,y,\,\frac{dy}{dx}) = 0,$$
then the equation of any isocline of $\Gamma$ has the form
$$F(x,\,y,\,K) = 0$$
where $K$ is \PMlinkescapetext{constant}.\\

For example, the family
$$y = e^{Cx}$$
of \PMlinkname{exponential}{ExponentialFunction} curves satisfies the differential equation\, $\frac{dy}{dx} = Ce^{Cx}$\, or\, $\frac{dy}{dx} = Cy$,\, whence the isoclines are\, $Cy =K$,\, i.e. they are horizontal lines.\\
