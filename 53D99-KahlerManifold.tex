Let $M$ be a  complex manifold with integrable \PMlinkname{complex structure}{AlmostComplexStructure}  $J$.

Suppose $M$ is also a Riemannian manifold with metric tensor $g$ such that $\forall_{X,Y} g(X,Y) = g(JX,JY)$. We say that $g$ is an \emph{Hermitian metric tensor}.

A differentiable manifold $M$ is said to be a \emph{K\"ahler manifold} iff all the following conditions are verified:
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$ is a complex manifold with \PMlinkescapeword{complex structure} complex structure $J$
\item $M$ is a Riemannian manifold with an Hermitian metric $g$
\item $J$ is covariantly constant with regard to the Levi-Civita connection ($\nabla J = 0$)
\end{itemize}

K\"ahler manifolds are symplectic in a natural way with symplectic form defined by $\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y)$
