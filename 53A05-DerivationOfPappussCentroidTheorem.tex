\textbf{I.}\, Let $s$ denote the arc rotating about the $x$-axis (and its length) and $R$ be the $y$-coordinate of the centroid of the arc.\, If the arc may be given by the equation
$$y \;=\; y(x)$$
where\, $a \le x \le b$, the area of the formed surface of revolution is
$$A \;=\; 2\pi\!\int_a^b\!y(x)\sqrt{1\!+\![y'(x)]^2}\,dx.$$
This can be concisely written
\begin{align}
A \;=\; 2\pi\!\int_s\!y\,ds
\end{align}
since differential-geometrically, the product $\sqrt{1\!+\![y'(x)]^2}\,dx$ is the arc-element.\, We rewrite (1) as
$$A \;=\; s\cdot2\pi\cdot\frac{1}{s}\!\int_s\!y\,ds.$$
Here, the last factor is the ordinate of the centroid of the rotating arc, whence we have the result
$$A \;=\; s \cdot2 \pi R$$
which states the first Pappus's centroid theorem.\\


\textbf{II.}\, For deriving the second Pappus's centroid theorem, we suppose that the region defined by
$$a \;\le\, x \;\le\; b, \quad 0 \;\le\; y_1(x) \;\le\, y \;\le\; y_2(x),$$
having the area $A$ and the centroid with the ordinate $R$, rotates about the $x$-axis and forms the solid of revolution with the volume $V$.\, The centroid of the area-element between the arcs\, $y = y_1(x)$\, and\, $y = y_2(x)$\, is $[y_2(x)\!+\!y_1(x)]/2$ when the abscissa is $x$; the area of this element with the width $dx$ is $[y_2(x)\!-\!y_1(x)]\,dx$.\, Thus we get the equation
$$R \;=\; \frac{1}{A}\int_a^b\frac{y_2(x)\!+\!y_1(x)}{2}[y_2(x)\!-y_1(x)]\,dx$$
which may be written shortly
\begin{align}
R \;=\; \frac{1}{2A}\int_a^b(y_2^2\!-\!y_1^2)\,dx.
\end{align}
The volume of the solid of revolution is
$$V \;=\; \pi\!\int_a^b(y_2^2\!-\!y_1^2)\,dx \;=\; A\cdot2\pi\cdot\frac{1}{2A}\!\int_a^b(y_2^2\!-\!y_1^2)\,dx.$$
By (2), this attains the form
$$V \;=\; A\cdot 2\pi R.$$
