\begin{document}
A line $\gamma$ on a surface $S$ is a {\em line of curvature} of $S$, if in every point of $\gamma$ one of the principal sections has common tangent with $\gamma$.

By the \PMlinkname{parent entry}{NormalCurvatures}, a surface \,$F(x,\,y,\,z) = 0$,\, where $F$ has continuous first and \PMlinkescapetext{second order} partial derivatives, has two distinct families of lines of curvature, which families are \PMlinkname{orthogonal}{ConvexAngle} to each other.

For example, the meridian curves and the circles of latitude are the two families of the lines of curvature on a surface of revolution.

On a developable surface, the other family of its curvature lines consists of the generatrices of the surface.

A necessary and sufficient condition for that the surface normals of a surface $S$ set along a curve $c$ on $S$ would form a developable surface, is that $c$ is a line of curvature of $S$.
