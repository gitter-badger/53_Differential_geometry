\begin{document}
A \emph{Sub-Riemannian} manifold is a triple $(M,\mathcal{H},g_{\mathcal{H}})$ where $M$ is a manifold,
$\mathcal{H}$ is a distribution (that is, a linear subbundle of the tangent bundle $TM$ of $M$), and
$g_{\mathcal{H}}$ is a metric on $\mathcal{H}$ induced by a fiber inner product on $\mathcal{H}$. The
distribution $\mathcal{H}$ is often referred to as the \emph{horizontal} distribution.
