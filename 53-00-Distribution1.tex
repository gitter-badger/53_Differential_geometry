In the following we will \PMlinkescapetext{mean} $C^\infty$ when we say smooth.

\begin{defn}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $m$.  Let $n \leq m$ and for each $x \in M$, we assign an $n$-dimensional subspace
$\Delta_x \subset T_x(M)$ of the tangent space in such a way that for a
neighbourhood $N_x \subset M$ of $x$ there exist $n$ linearly independent
smooth vector fields $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ such that for any point $y \in N_x$,
$X_1(y),\ldots,X_n(y)$ span $\Delta_y$.  We let $\Delta$ refer to the
collection of all the $\Delta_x$ for all $x \in M$ and we then call $\Delta$ a
{\em distribution} of dimension $n$ on $M$, or sometimes a
{\em $C^\infty$ $n$-plane distribution} on $M$.  The set of smooth
vector fields $\{ X_1,\ldots,X_n \}$ is called a {\em local basis} of $\Delta$.
\end{defn}

Note: The naming is unfortunate here as these distributions have nothing
to do with \PMlinkname{distributions in the sense of analysis}{Distribution}.
However the naming is in wide use.

\begin{defn}
We say that a distribution $\Delta$ on $M$
is {\em involutive} if for every point $x \in M$ there exists a local basis 
$\{ X_1,\ldots,X_n \}$
in a neighbourhood of $x$ such that for all $1 \leq i, j \leq n$, $[X_i,X_j]$
(the commutator of two vector fields) is in the span of 
$\{ X_1,\ldots,X_n \}$.  That is, if 
$[X_i,X_j]$ is a linear combination of $\{ X_1,\ldots,X_n \}$.
Normally this is written as $[ \Delta , \Delta ] \subset \Delta$.
\end{defn}
